Your email and your docker id are 2 separate things. It looks like you can use your email to log in the site but not the CLI. To get your docker id log into https://www.docker.com/ with your email and password. On the top right is docker id. Use that in the CLI and you'll probably be fine.

## docker build error


```Dockerfile
from centos:latest

RUN yum update -y && yum install httpd -y
```

"Error unpacking rpm package httpd-2.4.6-40.e17.centos.1"

```
I found the problem and a solution ! The problem was I had my Docker Storage Driver configure with "aufs". I just had to change the Storage Driver to "devicemapper". Apparently it's a problem on Ubuntu 15 and more and some Debian distributions.
```

`docker info` print docker daemon configuration

https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#configure-loop-lvm-mode-for-testing

    Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json. If it does not yet exist, create it. Assuming that the file was empty, add the following contents.
    
    {
      "storage-driver": "devicemapper"
    }
